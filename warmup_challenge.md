# Projectile

During a baseball game a batter hits the ball at a 31 degree angle with a velocity of 20 meters/second. What is the location of the ball after 3.7 seconds.

The equations are:

> x = sin(angle) \* velocity * t

> y = cos(angle) \* velocity \* t - ( 0.5 \* 9.8 * t<sup>2</sup>)

Write a Java program to compute the answer. You have 10 minutes you should not need more than 4.
