##ScrabbleDictionary

You work for a company making a "Scrabble" type game. You must create a class called ScrabbleDictionary. You can download a dictionary text file from the [WinEdt website](http://www.winedt.org/Dict/). Download the English language zip file. Inside you will find a file called "US.dic".

    package [lastname].scrabble;
    
    public class ScrabbleDictionary {
    
        public ScrabbleDictionary() {
            ...
        }
    
        /**
         * @return true if the dictionary contains the word, otherwise false. 
         */
        public boolean contains( String word ) {
            ...
        }
    
    }
    
Also create a ScrabbleDictionaryTest class that has methods to test the contains() method. 

Make sure when you finish that you push the ScrabbleDictionary.java, ScrabbleDictionaryTest.java and US.dic files to github.
