In Mac you can open up a command prompt by hitting search and typing "Terminal".

The Terminal is a text interface into your computer's file system. It mirrors what you would see if you opened up Finder. 

> cd [directory name]

cd stands for "Change Directory". 

> cd ..

moves up one directory

> ls

List the files in the current directory.
