Projectile math is the typically the first topic in any physics course. The correct answer is:

> x = 27.812056045142928

> y = 10.56603423791406

Did you get the correct answer? Not getting the correct answer to this problem is actually very common. Chances are your error had to do with your usage of [Math.sin()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#sin(double) and [Math.cos()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#cos(double). The preceeding links link to Java's official documentation known as the Javadocs. You should be used to reading the Javadocs.
