# JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

It is a format for representing "object data" as text. It is becoming more common to see this format where XML had been used years ago.

Like Java, an object block begins with a { and ends with a }

Variable names are encased in "s and are followed by a :

Like Java, an array begins with a [ and ends with a ]

A sample Json file for a bookstore could look like this.

    {
        "name" : "Bookstore on J",
        "address" "1234 Ave J",
        "books": [
            { 
                "title" : "Evolution Java",
                "author" : "Andrew Schwimmer",
                "isbn" : "978-3-16-148410-0" 
            },
            { 
                "title" : "Evolution Java",
                "author" : "Andrew Schwimmer",
                "isbn" : "978-3-16-148410-0" 
            },
            { 
                "title" : "Evolution Java",
                "author" : "Andrew Schwimmer",
                "isbn" : "978-3-16-148410-0" 
            }
        ]
    }
