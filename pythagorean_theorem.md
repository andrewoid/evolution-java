### Pythagorean Theorem

![](pythagoras-theorem.gif)

Create a class called PythagoreanTheorem.

    public class PythagoreanTheorem {
    
        /**
         *  Sets the value of A and B and computes C
         */
        public void setAB() { ... }
        /**
         *  Sets the value of A and C and computes B
         */
        public void setAC() { ... }
        /**
         *  Sets the value of B and C and computes A
         */
        public void setBC() { ... }
    
        public double getA() { ... }
        public double getB() { ... }
        public double getC() { ... }
    }
    
Write a class called PythagoreanTheoremTest with three unit tests that test the setAB(), setAC() and setBC() methods.
