###Downloading from Github

> git clone URL

This will download a repo. When working with Eclipse it's easiest to run this command while you are INSIDE your Eclipse workspace. Then in Eclipse go to New | Project and type in the name of the repo (it should be the name of the directory that the clone command created). Eclipse will see that this directory exists and will just import the project.


### Updating a git repo

Assuming you do not have any local changes the only command you need to run is 

> git pull
