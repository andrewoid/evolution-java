In this book we will be using command line git. 

You can install command line git from the following address for [Windows or Mac](https://git-scm.com/)

During installation make sure you check the box to enable Command Prompt integration to make using git easier.




There are git GUI applications. One I would recommend is [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for Window and Mac
